                     <p>Dr. Upender Pandel Sir,

                        Finding words to express the depth of my respect and gratitude for you is a challenge. Over these past three years, you have been much more than a distinguished teacher; you have been like a grandfather to me, guiding me with wisdom, compassion, and unwavering support. Your life lessons have enriched my journey far beyond the confines of textbooks.
                        
                       .I never came across any teacher in life, who showed genuine concern about the well-being and career  of a student like Upender Pandel Sir.You always addressed my concerns with the understanding and firmness of a loving grandfather, imparting not just discipline but valuable life lessons. Your guidance has been a beacon, teaching me to face challenges head-on and to embrace struggles as opportunities for growth. Your insights into career and life have instilled in me a profound respect for hard work and integrity.
                        
                        Pandel Sir told us his several life stories & i can't comprehend how someone can be so humble,soft-hearted and connected to his roots,after achieving such level of success ,and sparkling opportunities in life.Your influence has been transformative, providing me with direction and purpose. Your support and wisdom have shaped my path and enriched my life in ways words can scarcely capture. 
                        
                        Thank you, Sir, for your boundless affection and for being a guiding light in my academic and personal journey. Your impact on my life is immeasurable, and your role in it will always be cherished deeply.</p>

                     <p>Most Cool Professor, i ever met in my whole life.He is the enthusiasm of Metallurgy.
                        Lord.K.K Sir,you have saved me from problems numerous times 
                        and i can't think of another name inside MNIT Campus ,whenever i find a situation that i can't solve. I am 100% sure ,no academic professor in entire 
                    Indian Colleges can be more friendly,understanding and of loving nature like you.We have this common phrase among students,
                    "भाई कोई भी समस्या हो, कृष्णा सर के पास जाओ, वह संभाल लेंगे और समाधान कर देंगे" ! In colleges ,all respect earned by professors among students is either due to their academic achievements,power or fear.
                But for K.K Sir,our Meta department's boys' fraternity has this vibe of love for him, and respect due to that friendly-positive aura because he is almost everyone's favourite.
            Also , no-one can explain why we have this duo of K.K Sir and Pandel Sir.Our seniors had a very famous quote, "भाई, अब के.के.सर या Pandel सर ही इस बारे में कुछ कर सकते हैं। इसके बाद भी अगर ऐसा नहीं हुआ तो भगवान ही जाने।"
        Even when our seniors are gone,they still recall both K.K Sir and Pandel Sir's name, with joy .This is what everyone can't earn. </p>
